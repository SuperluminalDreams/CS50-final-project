### About:

This is a game about gravity. The player fires a projectile with an initial angle and velocity. 
On screen will be several bodies that exert gravitational force on the projectile. The player's goal is 
to make the projectile orbit the bodies for as long as possible before either exiting the screen 
or crashing into the bodies. 

### How to Play

CD to the final_project folder and run "python level_#.py" with '#' replaced by the desired level. 
Change initial velocity with the mouse wheel and aim the probe with the mouse. Have fun!
